Steps to prepare Cherokee data cards

If at least one of each Flex item with Semantic Field Content is tagged with the semantic domains,
The GetSemGuid.xsl will extract the semantic domain guids for each Semantic Field into semMap.xml.
Then the UpdSemGuid.xsl can be used to apply the same guids to all items in the fwdata file with
the same semantic field. The current file will need to be renamed to old and the created new file will
need to be renamed so it replaces the fwdata file. (This has to be done without Flex open on the project.)

1. Filter s.t.
   Citation Form(Che) non-blank
   Semantic Field is Non-blank
   Sound File is non-blank
   sorted ascending by Semantic Field
2. File, Export, Filtered LIFT
3. Use program to create Byki folder. (They are created in the bin/Debug folder.))
